A working version of the plugin can [viewed here](http://www.silverstone.co.uk/visiting/)

**Notes**

* This is not a stand-alone jQuery module, but has been extracted from a [larger project](http://www.silverstone.co.uk/visiting/), and has dependencies (e.g. images, SASS variables) not included in this repo.
* It was a proof of concept for a rapid prototype and has significant tasks outstanding, particularly to make it follow progressive enhancement principles.
